## Task
The Task's to write a program called "My Mastermind" an implementation of the famous game "Mastermind.

Mastermind is a game composed of 9 pieces of different colors.
A secret code is then composed of 4 distinct pieces.

The player has 10 attempts to find the secret code.
After each input, the game indicates to the player the number of well placed pieces and the number of misplaced pieces.

Pieces will be '0' '1' '2' '3' '4' '5' '6' '7' '8'.

If the player finds the code, he wins, and the game stops.
A misplaced piece is a piece that is present in the secret code but that is not in a good position.

The program read the player's input from the standard input.

## Description
To solved the problem, I googled and searched many online resources and I found them helpfull. 
I also engaged with my friends that are still working on the project and those that have already submitted their own.

## Installation
No any Installation is needed. The main aim was to implement the "My Mastermind" game using C Language for the purpose of learning.

## Usage
It worked correctly as it was designed to. And it taught me a lot.
